# MidBootcamp-Project
This repository contains the mid-bootcamp project I conducted during the Ironhack Data Analytics bootcamp. I reevaluated part of the dataset my supervisor and I created by experimental data collection as part of my BSc thesis.

The study focused on the effects of noradrenergic modulation on reinforcement learning. Modulation took place via a tVNS device in the left ear, moroever, a sham condition for control purposes was introducted. Other conditions (e.g. partial/full outcome, tonic/phasic stimulation) were also relevant for the initial thesis.

In the present analysis, a logistic regression model was made in order to predict the reward related switching behaviour between options based on one participants data.
Chi square tests confirmed the negative correlation between value of reward and number of switches to an alternative option.
